    <h1>Set up Eclipse IDE</h1>
    <p>
      To get started, you will first need to set up an Eclipse IDE with the <strong>RAP Tools</strong>
      plug-in. You can choose between downloading an Eclipse IDE package with RAP Tools included or 
      getting RAP Tools separately and installing them into your existing IDE.
    </p>

    <p>
      This screencast shows how to get started with developing RAP applications.
      It covers RAP target installation, creating a new RAP application and
      launching it in a web browser.
    </p>
    <h2>Get RAP Tools separately and install them into your existing Eclipse IDE</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">Download page</a></p>
    <p>
      If you rather want to use an existing Eclipse IDE, you can also get the RAP Tools
      separately and install them as a plug-in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        With Eclipse up and running, select the <strong>Help</strong> &gt;
        <strong>Install New Software ...</strong> menu entry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enter enter the RAP Update Site URL
        <strong>http://download.eclipse.org/rt/rap/1.3/tooling</strong>
        into the <strong>Work with</strong> field and press Enter.
      </li>
      <li>
        After a short while, an entry labelled <em>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</em> appears
        in the list below. Select its check box and click <strong>Next</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the the next page you may review the installation details.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accept the terms in the license agreement and click the
        <strong>Finish</strong> button.
      </li>
      <li>
        The feature and plug-ins will now be downloaded from the repository and
        installed locally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Confirm the following prompt to restart Eclipse.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="target-install">Let the RAP Tools install the target platform</h2>
    <p>
      RAP applications need to be compiled against the RAP runtime.
      To do so, the runtime needs to be set as the target platform in Eclipse.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Eclipse starts on a fresh workspace, a welcome page is displayed.
      Select the <strong>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</strong> section and
      choose <strong>Install Target Platform</strong> on the following page.
      In the upcoming dialog confirm the default values, which starts the target
      installation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the installation finished you are prepared to work with RAP.
      For your first steps you may read the
      <a href="examples.html">RAP Examples</a>
      topic and/or the other chapters of the getting started section.
