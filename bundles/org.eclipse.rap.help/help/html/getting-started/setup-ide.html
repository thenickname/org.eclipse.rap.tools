    <h1>Set up Eclipse</h1>
    <p>
      To get started, you should have an Eclipse IDE with RAP tooling installed.
      It's easiest to get the Eclipse package for RCP and RAP developers.
      See the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/rap/downloads/">downloads page</a> of the RAP website for details.

      This screencast shows how to get started with developing RAP applications.
      It covers RAP target installation, creating a new RAP application and
      launching it in a web browser.

    <h2>Let the RAP Tooling install the target platform</h2>
    <p>
      When Eclipse starts on a fresh workspace, a welcome page is displayed.
      Select the <strong>Rich Ajax Platform (RAP)</strong> section and
      choose <strong>Install Target Platform</strong> on the following page.
      In the upcoming dialog confirm the default values, which starts the target
      installation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the installation finished you are prepared to work with RAP.
      For your first steps you may read the
      <a href="examples.html">RAP Examples</a>
      topic and/or the other chapters of the getting started section.
